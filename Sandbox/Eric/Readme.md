## Initial Visualization Analysis from Tableau

We have used a Kaggle dataset intended to predict test scores for students.  There are 11 columns of data.  Some of the most features of most interest to us for our machine learning model include school setting (urban, suburban, or rural), school type (public versus non-public) and paid or reduced lunch qualification.  We are looking for the impact of specific features either individually or in combination with respect to test scores.

The test score data is provided with respect to pretest and posttest scores.

School setting and paid or reduced lunch qualification status appear to be consistent predictors of differences between the pretest and posttest scores.

Analysis must take into account the difference in the number of students in the different school settings.

Exploratory Data Analysis was performed looking at each individual school setting as well as the overall dataset.

The overall story told by our visualizations shows lunch status to be a significant indicator of differences pretest versus posttest most strongly in the urban school setting.

Variances were also looked at and were relatively consistent for all three settings with a much larger spread seen in the urban setting for students who did qualify for free or reduced lunch.

Teaching method (experimental versus standard) was another feature reviewed but for each set of features looked at it appears that lunch status is the most relevant predictor of test score differences pretest to posttest.
